# EL Control

EL Control is an Android Experiment which uses an IOIO's Serial Uart to control an Arduino project.
This is useful if you need to isolate voltage, but still want to have an Android device connected.

The goal of this experiment is to:

* Demonstrate the hardware capabilites of Android to work with other hardware quickly
* Demonstrate the flexibility of using Serial Connections on Android using IOIO
* Be easily built by anyone who can source the parts
* Run on as many Android devices as possible
* Use out-of-the box Android tools whenever possible.

The code in this experiment is meant to be easy to follow, and this is meant to be as simple as a
tutorial, yet showcase what is possible on Android.
